        any dispute over privacy are subject to this Privacy Policy and Our Terms and Conditions of use. Our Policy regarding the collection, use, and disclosure, if any, of personal information is very strict and we adhere to the best of practices to

    <p><u><b>Terms and Conditions for Online Fee Submission:-</b></u><br> Online transaction charges are not part of the Fee. The following transaction charges shall be applicable: Net Banking / Credit Cards / Debit Cards: As applicable All Fee rules as
        given in the Fee Book shall remain applicable. The Fee deposited through Credit Card/Debit Card/Net Banking will normally reach the Nrps account after 1-2 days. It is the sole responsibility of the candidate to ensure that the fee is deposited
        well in time. Nrps shall not be responsible for any not settled fee payment due to any reason. The Nrps also shall not be responsible, if the payment is refused or declined by the credit/debit card supplier for any reason. Terna College of Engineering
        does not warrant the availability of an online Fee Payment System every time. Terna College of Engineering will not be responsible for fine exemption if the last day student fee transition fails. We strongly advise that submit the fee through
        an Offline or Online Payment System before the last fee day comes.</p>

    <h1>Refund / Cancellation Policy :<br></h1>
    <p><i><u><b>Technical issue</b></u></i><br> In case of any technical issue due to which the payment gets deducted from the payerâ€™s account and does not show in our official ERP but the payment gateway service clearly mentions the confirmed settlement
        thereafter the College account receives the payment. We manually submit the payment in our ERP. It should take 7-10 working days for the payment to be credited to the College account.

        <i><u><b><br>Multiple Payments Case:</b></u></i><br> If double payment happens and the payment gateway service clearly mentions it, the school will refund the payment after the College account receives payment. Which should take 7-10 working days
        for the back payment or we can adjust the amount to the next month fee as per Payer’s request.

        <br><i><u><b>Other Payments Case:</b></u></i><br> In all other cases where there is a discrepancy in the fee paid, the parent has to directly contact the School and the College decision would be final.
